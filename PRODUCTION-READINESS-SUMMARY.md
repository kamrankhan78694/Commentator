## Deployment Instructions

1. **Pre-deployment Verification**
   ```bash
   npm run validate  # Runs lint + test + security audit
   npm run test:coverage  # Verify test coverage
   ```

2. **Deploy to Production**
   ```bash
   firebase deploy --only hosting  # Deploy with security headers
   ```

3. **Post-deployment Verification**
   ```bash
   curl -I https://commentator78694.web.app/  # Check security headers
   npm run test:e2e  # Run end-to-end tests
   ```

## Risk Assessment: LOW

- **Security Risk**: ðŸŸ¢ LOW - All vulnerabilities patched, comprehensive protection
- **Performance Risk**: ðŸŸ¢ LOW - Monitoring and thresholds in place
- **Reliability Risk**: ðŸŸ¢ LOW - Comprehensive testing and error handling
- **Compliance Risk**: ðŸŸ¢ LOW - Security headers and data protection implemented

## Recommendations for Production
