# 🗨️ Commentator

**Commentator** is an open-source project designed to improve transparency on the web by enabling community-driven feedback. It allows users to comment on any website—even those that disable native comments or review systems—helping others make informed decisions and avoid scams.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ **Universal Commenting** – Share feedback on any webpage, regardless of whether it supports native comments.
- 🛡️ **Fraud Prevention** – Expose suspicious websites by enabling users to leave honest reviews.
- 💬 **Open Participation** – Anyone can view or post comments without censorship.
- 🔓 **Fully Open-Source** – Transparent and community-driven, licensed under MIT.

## 🔧 How It Works

1. Users install a browser extension or use the Commentator interface.
2. When visiting a website, they can leave or view comments tied to the domain or specific URL.
3. Comments are stored securely and rendered dynamically.
4. Others benefit from the collective feedback to make better web decisions.
