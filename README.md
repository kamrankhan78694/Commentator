# 🗨️ Commentator

**Commentator** is an open-source project designed to improve transparency on the web by enabling community-driven feedback. It allows users to comment on any website—even those that disable native comments or review systems—helping others make informed decisions and avoid scams.

## 🎯 Project Goal: Decentralization

Our long-term vision is to make Commentator a **fully decentralized public commenting system** that cannot be controlled or censored by any single entity.

### Key Objectives:
- 🗂 **Decentralized Storage**: Store comment data on IPFS or Arweave using tools like `web3.storage` or `Bundlr`, ensuring content permanence and censorship resistance.
- 🆔 **Decentralized Identity (DID)**: Use Ethereum wallets (e.g., MetaMask) or identity protocols like ENS and Ceramic to allow users to sign comments without centralized accounts.
- 🗳️ **Community Moderation**: Implement upvote/downvote systems, and explore DAO-style moderation using token-based or reputation-based voting.
- 🔐 **Content Integrity**: Let users cryptographically sign their comments for authenticity and verifiability.
- 💡 **Open Protocol**: Create APIs and standards that can be used by other platforms to fetch or display Commentator data transparently.

This decentralized foundation ensures Commentator is not just a product—but a protocol that serves the public good.
