# Commentator Logo Design Documentation

## Design Concept

The new Commentator logo represents the core mission of universal web commenting through several key visual elements:

### Visual Elements

1. **Speech Bubble**: The primary element is a modern, rounded speech bubble that directly symbolizes comments and communication
2. **Comment Dots**: Three dots inside the bubble represent ongoing conversation and multiple comments
3. **Network Connection**: Small connection lines and nodes extending from the bubble symbolize web connectivity and the universal nature of the system
4. **Color Gradient**: A blue-to-purple gradient (#667eea to #764ba2) that matches the existing website design and conveys trust, technology, and communication

### Design Principles

- **Scalability**: Created as SVG for perfect scaling from favicon to large displays
- **Recognition**: Distinctive shape that's immediately recognizable as a commenting system
- **Modern**: Clean, minimalist design that fits current web design trends
- **Accessibility**: High contrast and clear iconography
- **Brand Consistency**: Colors and typography match the existing website design
